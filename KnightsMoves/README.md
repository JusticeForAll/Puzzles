# Print Knight's Moves Pattern
This program fills a two-dimensional array with the possible transitions of the knight chess figure from a given position to other valid positions. 
The program leaves no empty slots (every slot in the array will contain a number corresponding to the "turn" on which the knight "visited" that slot.)
